# MapGraph
Relational Database Simulator 

Creates a network of nodes (one node for each datafile provided) where each node is an entry in an open-addressed hashmap. 

##Usage: $MapGraph <file1> <file2> <file3> ....
  
Each file should represents a dictionary in the form of 'key:value:' (one per line).	For each file, a hashmap is created and all of the key-value pairs are added to it. As the files are transformed into hashmaps, edges of the graph are generated by matching keys between hashmaps, so that "tom":"60" in one map will be connected by an edge to "tom":"cat" in another map. The graph can then be queried to show all of the values in all of the maps for a given key. 

This model is capable of having multiple different relationships between different keys in different hashmaps, but for this demonstration it simply matches	entries with the same key.
